Today I cloned the repo from `unfoldingWord` and ran:
`npx create-react-app book-package-app`. 
The command renamed my `README.md` to `README.old.md`. So I combined them into one and removed the renamed one. I then committed and pushed to initialize the project in Github with *just* the React artifacts.

I then ran `yarn start` and the application started a new tab in my Chrome browser with this in the address bar: `http://localhost:3000/`. Worked fine.
